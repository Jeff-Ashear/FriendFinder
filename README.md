1. The purpose of this app is to match the user with one of a battery of potential climbing partners.  It provides the user with a brief survey, and compaires their answers to those in the apps data to find an appropriate match.

2. The app is organized with MVC architecture.  Data is stored as an array of objects in the "Data" folder. The "public" folder contains the "Home" and "Survey" pages as well as a style sheet.  Home welcomes the user and explains how to use the app.  The everything else will happen on the surey page.   The get routes are in the "htmlRoutes" file.  The "apiRoutes" file contains data routing, as well as the match  making logic.
